**Abstract**

> As climate change effects become increasingly salient, the need for stringent climate
policies becomes more pressing. The implementation of such policies is often met with
resistance from the public due to their perceived costs and distributional implications.
Scholars have mostly focused on material compensations to increase public support
among policy losers. This paper goes beyond the existing literature by showing how
what we term symbolic policies can enhance support for costlier policies. We define
symbolic policies as policies sending meaningful messages to the public but having low
material impacts. We argue that without changing the material costs that climate
policies impose, symbolic policies increase public support by altering the message
that costly policies convey. We demonstrate our argument using survey experiments
and qualitative interviews conducted in France, showing that symbolic policies can
significantly increase support for costly climate policies and increase perceptions of
fairness, elite responsiveness and policy effectiveness.
